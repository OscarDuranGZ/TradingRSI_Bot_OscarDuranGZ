## üîç Overview

TradingRSI Notifier is a custom-built Telegram bot designed to notify users when Bitcoin (BTC) hits **oversold RSI levels** or **drops significantly below its all-time high**, using real-time data from the Binance API.

This project was created as a personal solution for automated monitoring of long-term entry opportunities in BTC, based on two key indicators:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index) Weekly < 20**
- **Price drop ‚â• 50% from ATH**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- üì≤ **Telegram notifications** to registered users
- üîÑ **Automated weekly RSI and price checks** using Binance data
- üìâ **Configurable RSI thresholds and ATH price levels**
- ‚úÖ Uses `asyncio` for efficient bot operations
- üîê Manual access control via `usuarios.json`

## üß† How It Works

1. The bot fetches weekly BTC/EUR candle data via Binance API.
2. It calculates RSI values and compares the current price to the ATH threshold.
3. If any condition is met (RSI < 20 or price < -50%), it sends an alert via Telegram to the registered users.
4. Users must be pre-registered manually or via a secure `/start` access system.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Binance API (via `python-binance`)
- Telegram Bot API (via `python-telegram-bot`)
- Pandas for data analysis
- Asyncio for async task management
